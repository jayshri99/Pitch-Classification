# pitch-classification

The goal of this MP is to create a machine learning system for classifying pitches thrown in MLB games.

Have advanced tracking technology that can instantly record speed, spin, and other characteristics for each pitch.

Have a trained classifier for pitch type based on the pitch’s characteristics.
In real time, make predictions of pitch type as soon as the pitch’s characteristics are recorded.

Will make make one-model-per-pitcher.
